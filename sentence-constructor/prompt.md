    Possible Sentence Structure
    Subject + Verb + Location
    Example: Bears are at the door → [Subject] + [Verb] + [Location]
    Question Structure: Subject + Verb + Object + Location?
    Example: Did you leave the garbage out? → [Subject] + [Verb] + [Object] + [Location]
    Clues to Guide You to the Answer
    "Bears are at the door" → Think about using "nọ" (to be/stay) to describe location.
    "Door" in Igbo is "ọnụ ụzọ".
    "Did you leave" → Use the verb "hapụ" in the past tense form.
    "Garbage" translates to "mkpofu".
    "Out" can be translated as "n’èzí" (outside) or something similar.
    Make sure your sentence reflects the natural Igbo structure rather than a direct word-for-word translation.
