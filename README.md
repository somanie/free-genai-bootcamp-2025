This repository documents my journey through the GenAI Bootcamp 2025 organized by Andrew Brown. I‚Äôll be designing and developing AI-powered learning applications, focusing on real-world GenAI solutions, model selection, prompt engineering, and cloud deployment.


## Bootcamp Overview
The GenAI Bootcamp 2025 is designed to help participants:

Understand the capabilities & limitations of GenAI.
Apply GenAI to real-world business cases through projects.
Learn to architect & deploy GenAI workloads effectively.
Each week, the difficulty level increases, requiring strong problem-solving and adaptability. Many participants may drop out, but I plan to push through and complete all challenges.

The school has an existing learning portal and learning record store. 
You've been tasked to:
‚Ä¢	build a collection of learning apps using various use-cases of AI
‚Ä¢	Maintain the learning experience the learning portal using AI developer tools
‚Ä¢	Extend the platform to support various languages

## Business Scenario
I've been hired as an AI Engineer for an Igbo (Language Learning Center) to:

Expand language learning through AI-powered applications.
Enhance student engagement between instructor-led classes.
Leverage AI for personalized English-Korean language practice.
Many students struggle with real-world English fluency due to a lack of interactive, personalized practice. These AI-powered apps aim to bridge that gap.
